\section{Introduction}\label{sect:intro}

Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for studying galaxies and cosmology.
Strong lenses have been used to probe the mass structure of massive galaxies \citep{Aug++10, ORF14, Son++15, Sha++21}, to detect substructure \citep{Veg++12, Hez++16, Nie++20}, to carry out detailed studies of magnified star-forming galaxies \citep{Jon++13}, and to measure the expansion rate of the universe with time delays \citep[see][for a review]{T+M16}.

Strong lenses, however, are a biased subset of the general population of galaxies and background sources.
A necessary condition for a galaxy to act as a strong lens with respect to a given source is that its projected surface mass density $\Sigma(\boldsymbol\theta)$ must be larger than the critical surface mass density for lensing $\Sigma_{\mathrm{cr}}$ at at least one position $\boldsymbol\theta$ \citep{SEF92}.
This condition excludes objects with a very diffuse mass distribution from the population of lenses.
In general, galaxies with a higher concentration of mass are more likely to be strong lenses, and are therefore over-represented in lens samples.

The luminosity and size distribution of strongly lensed sources is also biased with respect to the general population of background galaxies.
For instance, lensing magnification allows the detection of fainter objects with respect to the field, and galaxies that are very extended with respect to the Einstein radius are less likely to be classified as strongly lensed, since their magnification averaged over their size tends to be low \citep[see also the discussion in section 5.3 of][]{O+A17}.

In general, the probability distribution $\prsl$ of a sample of strong lenses from a given survey with selection criterion $S$ is given by \citep{Son22}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:one}
\prsl(\psilens,\psisource|S) \propto \prlens(\psilens)\prsource(\psisource)\pdet(\psilens,\psisource|S).
\end{equation}
In the equation above, $\psilens$ is the set of parameters describing the properties of foreground galaxies that are relevant for lensing, such as their redshift and mass distribution; $\psisource$ is the set of parameters describing background sources; $\prlens$ and $\prsource$ describe the general distribution of foreground galaxies and background sources in the absence of lensing; and $\pdet$ describes the probability of detecting a lens-source system with parameters $\psilens$ and $\psisource$ given the criterion $S$ used to define a lens.
This last factor takes into account both physical effects, that is whether a lens with parameters $\psilens$ produces a strongly lensed image of a source with parameters $\psisource$, and survey selection effects, that is whether such an image can be recognised as a strong lens.

The left-hand side of \Eref{eq:one} is directly accessible from strong lensing observations. If the main goal of a lensing survey is to characterise the properties of the strong lens population, then it can be accomplished by directly analysing this term. For many applications of strong lensing, however, the aim is to constrain the properties of the general galaxy or source population, $\prlens$ and $\prsource$, which are coupled in a nontrivial way via the lens detection probability $\pdet$.
In order to obtain an unbiased estimate of either $\prlens$ or $\prsource$, then, it is necessary to invert \Eref{eq:one}.
In principle, this can be done with a Bayesian hierarchical formalism, provided that the lens detection probability $\pdet$ is known \citep{Son22}.
For most of the existing strong lensing surveys, however, characterising $\pdet$ is very challenging: the process determining whether a system is included in a strong lens sample is typically a combination of several cuts, usually involving a nontrivial visual selection step. 

The problem of inverting \Eref{eq:one} is a difficult one to tackle exactly.
Few studies have attempted to explicitly account for strong lensing selection effects, usually by making ad-hoc simplifying assumptions \citep{Son++15,O+A17,Son++19}.
%The problem of the invertibility of \Eref{eq:one} can be simplified by adopting lens selection criteria that can be easily forward-modelled: for instance by building samples that are complete above a well-defined observational cut \citep{Son22}.
%The problem can be simplified by adopting lens selection criteria that can be easily forward-modelled: for instance by building samples that are complete above a well-defined observational cut \citep{Son22}.
Whether it is necessary to invert \Eref{eq:one}, however, depends on the severity of the strong lensing bias that needs to be corrected and on the accuracy requirements on the key quantities of interest.

In this paper we aim to quantify the strength of the strong lensing bias on a series of foreground galaxy and background source parameters. %, under realistic assumptions for the lens detection probability $\pdet$.
In particular, we aim to determine how strong lenses differ from the general population of foreground galaxies and background sources in terms of a) the radial mass structure of the lenses (i.e. their stellar and dark matter mass density profiles); b) the ellipticity of the lenses; c) the size-magnitude distribution of the lensed sources.
The answer to this question depends on 1) how the lens detection probability $\pdet$ varies as a function of galaxy and source properties, and on 2) the shape of the galaxy and source parameters distribution $\prlens$ and $\prsource$. To understand this second point we can imagine the limiting case in which both $\prlens$ and $\prsource$ are Dirac delta functions: in this limit, $\prsl$ simply reduces to the product $\prlens\prsource$ up to a scaling constant, corresponding to a case in which the lensing bias is none.

\citet{MVK09} carried out a thorough study of point 1): they quantified how the properties of a lens galaxy determine its probability of creating a lensing event with a point source.
In this work we revisit the \citet{MVK09} study, we expand it to the extended source case and, most importantly, we address point 2) as well: we simulate large populations of strong lenses using semi-analytic models, simulate lensing surveys with realistic assumptions for the lens probability $\pdet$ and quantify the lensing bias under various scenarios.
We explore how the results change as a function of the scatter in mass parameters at fixed light, and as a function of source type: we simulate both galaxy and quasar sources.

%In light of the results of our experiments, we discuss to what extent can studies of galaxy structure based on strong lenses be generalised to describe non-lens galaxies.
Finally, we address the question of how different are galaxy-galaxy lens samples from sets of galaxy-quasar lenses. This last point is relevant for time-delay cosmography studies, in which measurements of the time-delay between the multiple images of a strongly lensed quasar are used to constrain the expansion rate of the Universe. Galaxy-galaxy lenses can in principle be used to help break some of the model degeneracies affecting these measurements \citep{B+T21}, but any difference between the two lens classes can in principle introduce biases, if not corrected for.
With this study we aim to quantify this bias.

The structure of this work is the following.
\Sref{sect:basics} introduces the basics of gravitational lensing.
In \Sref{sect:indlenses} we study individual lens systems, to look for trends in the lensing cross-section with various lens and source properties.
In \Sref{sect:lenspop} we describe our simulations of lens populations.
In \Sref{sect:results} we show the results of our analysis on the simulated lens populations.
We discuss the results in \Sref{sect:discuss} and draw conclusions in \Sref{sect:concl}.

The Python code used for the simulation and analysis of the lens sample can be found in a dedicated section of a GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/astrosonnen/strong_lensing_tools}}.

\section{Strong lensing basics}\label{sect:basics}

The lensing properties of an object with respect to a source depend solely on its dimensionless surface mass density distribution $\kappa(\boldsymbol\theta)$ (also referred to as the convergence), 
% ratio between its surface mass density distribution and the critical surface mass density for lensing:
\begin{equation}
\kappa(\boldsymbol\theta) = \dfrac{\Sigma(\boldsymbol\theta)}{\Sigma_{\mathrm{cs}}},
\end{equation}
which is the ratio between the projected surface mass density of the lens and the critical surface mass density for lensing.
The latter quantity is defined as
%The quantity $\Sigma_{\matrhrm{cs}}$ is the critical surface mass density for lensing, defined as
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{cr} = \dfrac{c^2D_s}{4\pi G D_d D_{ds}},
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light, $G$ the gravitational constant, and $D_d$, $D_s$, and $D_{ds}$ are the angular diameter distances between the observer and the lens, the observer and the source, and the lens and the source, respectively.

Given a source at angular position $\boldsymbol\beta$, images of it form at the positions $\boldsymbol\theta$ that are solutions of the lens equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lenseq}
\boldsymbol\beta = \boldsymbol\theta - \boldsymbol\alpha(\boldsymbol\theta),
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol\alpha$ is the deflection angle of the lens.
This can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless surface mass density by means of the following integral over the whole sky:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\alpha(\boldsymbol\theta) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} d^2\boldsymbol\theta' \kappa(\boldsymbol\theta')\dfrac{\boldsymbol\theta - \boldsymbol\theta'}{|\boldsymbol\theta - \boldsymbol\theta'|^2}.
\end{equation}


\subsection{The axisymmetric lens}

In the special case of an axisymmetric lens we can simplify the notation by considering a single coordinate axis with origin at the centre of the lens. We label the components of the image position, source position and deflection angle along this axis as $\theta$, $\beta$ and $\alpha$, respectively.
The lens equation for an axisymmetric lens then becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1dlenseq}
\beta = \theta - \alpha(\theta),
\end{equation}
and the expression for the deflection angle reduces to
%In the special case of an axisymmetric lens, the deflection angle, calculated along an arbitrary axis passing through the lens centre, reduces to
\begin{equation}
\alpha(\theta) = \frac{2}{\theta}\int_0^{\theta} d\theta' \kappa(\theta') \theta'.
\end{equation}
This can also be expressed in terms of the total projected mass enclosed within a circle with angular radius equal to $\theta$:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(\theta) = \frac{1}{\pi\theta}\dfrac{M(<\theta)}{\Sigma_{\mathrm{cr}}D_{\mathrm{d}}^2}.
\end{equation}

A very important quantity for describing the strength of a strong lens is the Einstein radius, $\tein$. For an axisymmetric lens, this is the radius corresponding to the solution of \Eref{eq:lenseq} for a source placed at the same angular position as the lens centre ($\beta=0$).
The circle with radius equal to $\tein$ is known as the tangential critical curve. Images that form here have infinite magnification in the tangential direction.

It can be shown that $\tein$ satisfies the following condition,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:criteq}
\bar{\kappa}(<\tein) = 1,
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\kappa}(<\theta)$ is the average surface mass density within a radius equal to $\theta$:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\kappa}(<\theta) \equiv \frac{2}{\theta^2}\int_0^{\theta}d\theta' \kappa(\theta')\theta'.
\end{equation}
Based on \Eref{eq:criteq},
%The average surface mass density within $\tein$ is equal to one.
%For this reason, 
we generalise the definition of $\tein$ to the non-axisymmetric case as the circularised radius of the isodensity contour that encloses an average surface mass density equal to $\Sigma_{\mathrm{cr}}$.

Axisymmetric lenses with a density profile of the kind considered in section \ref{ssec:profile} typically produce either one or three images of a point source.
\Fref{fig:scheme} helps to visualise this property.
%\Fref{fig:scheme}, which shows the quantity $\theta - \alpha(\theta)$ as a function of the position in the image plane $\theta$, helps to visualise this property. 
Plotted in \Fref{fig:scheme} is the quantity $\theta - \alpha(\theta)$ as a function of the position in the image plane $\theta$, for the same lens models considered in \Fref{fig:kappa}.
According to \Eref{eq:1dlenseq}, images form at the locations where this quantity equals the position of the source. 
Therefore, given a source position $\beta$, the number of images and their location can be determined by drawing a horizontal line at the value $\beta$ on the vertical axis, and finding the points where this line intersects the $\theta - \alpha(\theta)$ curves.

For small values of $\beta$ (for sources close to the lens centre), the number of images that are produced is three: the source is strongly lensed. For large values of $\beta$, instead, only one image is formed.
The value of $\beta$ where the transition occurs is known as the radial caustic, which is marked by the horizontal dotted line in \Fref{fig:scheme}. 
As can be seen from \Fref{fig:scheme}, a source at this location is mapped to the stationary point of the $\theta - \alpha(\theta)$ curve. 
%this value corresponds to the stationary point of the $\theta - \alpha(\theta)$ curve. 
That location on the image plane is known as the radial critical curve. 
Images that form there have a formally infinite magnification in the radial direction\footnote{The slope of the $\theta - \alpha(\theta)$ curve is the inverse of the radial magnification. This can be understood by taking the derivative of \Eref{eq:1dlenseq} with respect to $\theta$.}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{composite_fixedap_scheme.eps}
\caption{
The lens equation of axisymmetric lenses. Solid lines: right-hand side of \Eref{eq:1dlenseq} for the five lenses with density profile plotted in \Fref{fig:kappa}. 
Given a source at position $\beta$, its lensed images form at the values of $\theta$ where the solid line intersects a horizontal line located at $\beta$ on the vertical axis. 
Dotted lines: positions of the radial caustics. Sources located within the radial caustic of a given lens produce three images.
\label{fig:scheme}
}
\end{figure}
%The slope of the $\theta - \alpha(\theta)$ curve is the inverse of the magnification of an image in the radial direction. 
%This can be understood by noting that, according to \Eref{eq:1dlenseq}, the derivative of $\theta - \alpha(\theta)$ is equal to $d\beta/d\theta$, which quantifies the ratio between an infinitesimal displacement in the radial direction in the source plane and the corresponding displacement in the image plane.
%Stationary points of the $\theta - \alpha(\theta)$ curve, therefore, are points of infinite magnification in the radial direction. For a given axisymmetric lens, these points describe a circle known as the radial critical curve. 
%The corresponding curve in the source plane, the radius of which is given by the value of $\theta - \alpha(\theta)$ at the stationary point, is known as the radial caustic.
%As can be seen in \Fref{fig:scheme}, sources that lie within the radial caustic are strongly lensed into three images, while sources that lie outside of it produce only one image.

%Strong lenses also have a tangential critical curve, where the magnification along the tangential direction is formally infinite. For an axisymmetric lens, the tangential critical curve is a circle with radius equal to the Einstein radius, and the corresponding tangential caustic collapses to the $\beta=0$ point in the source plane.

\section{Individual lenses}\label{sect:indlenses}

In this section we study how the probability of a strong lensing event varies as a function of lens and source properties.
In order to do so, it is useful to introduce the concept of strong lensing cross-section.
Given a foreground galaxy with parameters $\psilens$, a background source with parameters $\psisource$, and a criterion $S$ to define a strong lensing event, the strong lensing cross-section is defined as \citep{Son22}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:crosssect}
\crosssect = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} d\boldsymbol\beta \pdet(\psilens,\psisourcenobeta,\boldsymbol\beta|S),
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol\beta$ is the position of the background source and the integral is carried out over the whole sky.
The definition above is valid for both a point source and an extended source: although there is no unique way of defining the position of an extended source, the integral over the sky ensures that the result is independent of how the source position is defined.
In the limit of low density of background sources, which is satisfied in all practical cases, the probability of a lensing event is proportional to $\crosssect$.

In this section we compute $\crosssect$ in a series of different scenarios of increasing complexity.
%We first introduce the basic equations of gravitational lensing in section \ref{ssec:lensbasics}.
%Then, in section \ref{ssec:profile}, we present the model family adopted to describe the radial density profile of the lenses in our experiments.
The model family adopted to describe the radial density profile of the lenses is the same in all of our experiments. We describe this in \ref{ssec:profile}. %, among with the basic equations of gravitational lensing.
%In section \ref{ssec:axsymmpoint} we consider axisymmetric lenses and point sources.
In section \ref{ssec:axsymmpoint} we show calculations of the strong lensing cross-section in the case of axisymmetric lenses and point sources.
In section \ref{ssec:ellpoint} we generalise the lens geometry to elliptical, while in section \ref{ssec:ellext} we replace point sources with extended sources.


%\subsection{Strong lensing basics}\label{ssec:lensbasics}


\subsection{Lens density profile}\label{ssec:profile}

Throughout this work we describe the mass distribution of the lens galaxies with a two-component model consisting of a S\'{e}rsic profile, describing the baryonic component of a galaxy, and a generalised Navarro, Frenk \& White (gNFW) profile, describing the dark matter halo.
We assume that the two components are concentric.
We also assume that the baryonic component consists entirely of stars.
This is a good approximation for the majority of the known strong lenses, which are massive elliptical galaxies with little gas.
Finally, we assume that the light distribution of the stellar component follows its mass distribution exactly. That is, we do not allow for the presence of gradients in the stellar mass-to-light ratio. This assumption is probably broken in real galaxies but, as we discuss in \Sref{sect:discuss}, does not impact our investigation.

%Lensing-related quantities depend on the projected mass distribution $\Sigma(R)$.
%For the purpose of computing lensing-related quantities, the projected massdistribution $\Sigma(R)$ is needed.
%For a S\'{e}rsic profile, this is given by
The projected surface mass density of a S\'{e}rsic profile is given by
\begin{equation}
\Sigma(R) = \Sigma_0 \exp{\left\{-b\left(\frac{R}{\reff}\right)^{1/4}\right\}},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_0 = \frac{\mstar b^{2n}}{2\pi n \reff^2 \Gamma(2n)},
\end{equation}
where $\mstar$ is the total mass, $\reff$ is the radius enclosing half of the total mass, $n$ is the S\'{e}rsic index, $\Gamma$ is the incomplete Gamma function, and $b$ is given by \citep{C+B99}
\begin{equation}
b(n) \approx 2n -\frac13 + \frac{4}{405n} + \frac{46}{25515n^2} + O(n^{-3}).
\end{equation}

The dark matter component is first defined by means of its three-dimensional distribution, which for a spherically symmetric gNFW profile is
\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \dfrac{\rho_0}{(r/r_s)^{\gammadm}\left(1 + r/r_s\right)^{3-\gammadm}}.
\end{equation}
The parameter $\gammadm$ is the inner density slope, $\rho_0$ is a normalisation parameter, while $r_s$ is the scale radius. The logarithmic slope of the density profile transitions from $-\gammadm$ to $-3$ at a radius $r\approx r_s$.
The projected surface mass density of a gNFW profile can be expressed in terms of the following integral \citep{WTS01}:
\begin{equation}
\Sigma(R) = 2r_s\rho_0 \left(\frac{R}{r_s}\right)^{1-\gammadm}\int_0^{\pi/2} dx \sin{x}(\sin{x} + R/r_s)^{\gammadm-3}.
\end{equation}

\Fref{fig:kappa} shows the dimensionless surface mass density profile S\'{e}rsic + gNFW models with various values of the inner dark matter density slope $\gammadm$ and of the fraction of projected dark matter mass within the half-light radius, $\fdm$.
All of the profiles have a S\'{e}rsic index $n=4$, a dark matter scale radius equal to ten times $\reff$, and are normalised in such a way that the Einstein radius is equal to the half-mass radius of the stellar component. 
Two main features emerge from \Fref{fig:kappa}. First, the baryons generally dominate the total density in the inner regions $(\theta < \tein)$, while the dark matter is the main component at large radii.
Second, models with different dark matter fractions and inner dark matter slopes can conspire to produce very similar total density profiles. 
%it is possible to build models with different dark matter fractions and inner dark matter slopes, but with very similar total density profiles. 
This is the case, for example, of the ($\fdm=0.5,\gammadm=1.5$) and the ($\fdm=0.2,\gammadm=2.0$) models (green and blue lines in \Fref{fig:kappa}).
