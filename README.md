# Strong lensing selection effects

This project aims at quantifying the imporance of selection effects in strong lensing surveys.
The idea came up at the Lorentz Center workshop ["Bridging gaps between dynamical probes of galaxies"](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/bridging-gaps-between-dynamical-probes-of-galaxies-2022.html).
